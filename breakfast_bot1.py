The injured sweet potato was taken to emergency at the hospital and rushed into surgery./n After a long and agonizing wait, the doctor finally appeared. He told the uninjured sweet potato, I have good news, and I have bad news./n The good news is that your friend is going to pull through. The bad news is that he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of his life.")
